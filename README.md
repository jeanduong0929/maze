# AI Tooling in Software Development: Enhanced Maze Solver Project Lab

## Lab Description
This lab focuses on using AI tooling to enhance productivity and problem-solving skills in a coding environment. You will work on a Java maze-solving project involving Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. The challenge is to use AI tools like GitHub Copilot to not only understand and comment on the code but also to solve problems and fill gaps in the existing codebase.

## Objectives
1. **Leveraging AI for Code Comprehension**: Use AI tools to gain insights into complex code segments.
2. **Enhancing Code with AI Assistance**: Apply AI suggestions to improve and optimize code.
3. **Documenting Code via AI**: Utilize AI for efficient and informative commenting.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Explore the Maze Solver Code
- Familiarize yourself with the **MazeApplication**, **MazeSolver**, and **Point** classes.
- Identify key areas like file handling, maze traversal algorithms (DFS and BFS), and UI interactions.

### Step 2: Using AI for Code Understanding
- Activate GitHub Copilot or a similar AI tool in your IDE.
- Hover over complex code segments. AI tools often provide tooltips explaining the code logic.
- For unclear methods or logic, prompt the AI tool with comments like “// Explain this function” or “// What does this block of code do?”.
- Compare AI-generated explanations with your understanding to develop a deeper insight.

### Step 3: AI-Assisted Code Commenting
- In methods lacking comments, write a comment starter like “// This function is designed to...” and let the AI tool complete it.
- Review and edit AI-generated comments for accuracy and clarity.
- Pay special attention to the **stackDFS** and **queueBFS** methods. Use AI to detail each step of these algorithms.

### Step 4: Solving Problems with AI Tooling
- Identify any bugs or inefficiencies in the code. Use AI suggestions for fixes or optimizations.
- Challenge yourself to enhance the maze-solving logic. For instance, ask the AI tool, “// How can I optimize this DFS algorithm?”.
Implement AI-suggested changes and test their effectiveness.

### Step 5: Reflect on AI Tooling Efficiency
- After completing the lab, assess how AI tools affected your productivity and understanding.
- Consider scenarios where AI tooling could be particularly beneficial in a team setting or with legacy code.

## Environment Setup
Ensure Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later is installed.
Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
Install GitHub Copilot or a similar AI code assistant tool in your IDE.

## Files Overview
- **MazeApplication.java**: Manages file input and user interaction.
- **MazeSolver.java**: Contains maze-solving logic using DFS and BFS.
- **Point.java**: Represents coordinates in the maze.

## Build and Execution
Run the project in your IDE with AI tooling enabled.
Actively use AI suggestions for understanding, commenting, and code optimization.

## FAQ
- **Do I need advanced Java knowledge for this lab?**
Basic Java understanding is necessary, but AI tools can help bridge knowledge gaps.

- **What if AI suggestions are incorrect?**
AI tools are not infallible. Use them as a starting point and apply your judgment and understanding.

## Discussion and Further Resources
- Consider how AI tools like GitHub Copilot can transform collaborative coding and code maintenance.
